## Record of Absence

“Hey, did you hear on the radio that the guy who robbed the bank on Gordon street was never caught? Apparently, somebody who lives in the apartment across the street saw it happen though.” Henry and I were always reading articles on the newspaper or on our phones as a source of entertainment during class just to kill time. There was a robbery that took place about a month ago at a bank, however, the evidence was insufficient due to the lack of security. Who knew the lock on bank doors would be easy to pick?
It doesn’t make sense to me how nobody has made a way for people to record on cameras yet, even though we have the ability to take pictures. It would make things so much easier, and security would actually be useful.
“Yeah, that’s crazy. Do you want to catch a movie tonight after we finish this assignment?” I ask Henry, just to brighten up the mood. Also, he always pays for the movies.
“Steph, honestly. I’m going to be honest with you, I’m getting sick of these animated movies. And I will not get caught going to one. I don’t know any other twenty-one-year-olds that go to watch animation movies.”
“It’s not animation movies, like kid movies. Don’t be lame. It’s not like Barbie. They make these movies with a lot of editing and special effects to make them look legit. I don’t want to go anymore if you’re going to be like that.” I return to listening to Mr. Smith talk about human computer interaction and the GOMS model.
Everything we do and have is completely created using CGI. The movies that we watch with friends, the news my father watches on the TV each morning, the shows my little brother watches after supper for thirty minutes, there are even little applications on our phones we can use to create videos with our own characters that look like us. If it’s not CGI, we rely a lot on radios, print, and just people in general. 
Like the robbery that happened in the bank a month ago, there was only one witness that was able to help out with the investigation, and all they could rely on was the guy’s ability to describe what the person looked like. In the dark. From across the street. Not to mention, the witness was quite literally a sixty-two-year-old male. Imagine how that turned out. I’m not going to lie, ninety percent of the time during a crime, they can use CGI to create a real-life model of what the suspects look like with the help of witnesses.
One movie that I watched a couple years ago, was a reenactment of the devastating avalanche that happened in Europe. At the very end of the movie, they showed how they made the movie. They brought in so many witnesses, editors, an put together photographs that people had taken. All the directors had to do was put the puzzle pieces together, and the witnesses even said it looked like the real thing. 
Movies and plays are our main source of entertainment, although there is quite a big age difference in people who go to see one or the other. The younger crowds usually watch CGI created movies while older people prefer going to plays and musicals. Except for Henry, he’s with the older crowd.
There are definitely times where I wish I could record a moment in my life and replay it later down the road, but I’ve learned to appreciate the moment and be in the moment with the people around me. 

## Micro Essay

Media is constantly changing, evolving, and sometimes even backtracking throughout time. My short story demonstrates the idea that media is not something of the past, or future but of the present. Throughout the story, Stephanie explains how there is no such thing as video cameras in her present year. However, Stephanie introduces various alternatives to video cameras and ways that her culture has maneuvered around the absence of video cameras but still ending up with similar results to the world that has the technology to record through a camera. In Stephanie’s world, they rely heavily on media that we consider “old” like newspapers and radios in order to make up for the loss of videos. Jussi Parikka discusses how “… New media remediates old media … New media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us.”. This clearly supports the idea of the short story that although video cameras were never invented, they have figured out ways to get the same results as you would through a video camera. The advancements of CGI are able to produce movies, TV shows, news, videos, without the actual invention of video cameras itself, therefore creating the illusion that video cameras are “old media” compared to the advancement of CGI, which would be the “new media”. Therefore, the “new media” that is changing user habits would be the CGI that creates the results of the video camera, which would be the “old media that never left us”.
